## Agent Roles

### 1. Design Validator
**Purpose**: Critique mechanics, suggest simplifications, identify fun-killers

**Questions for each system**:
1. What problem does it solve?
2. Does it create more complexity than value?
3. Would an 8-year-old understand it?
4. Does it serve the emotional journey?
5. Can it be simplified or eliminated?

### 2. Market Scout
**Purpose**: Analyze market fit, suggest publisher positioning

**Research areas**:
- 3-5 comparable successful games
- What makes Yumea unique
- Publisher fit analysis
- Kickstarter feasibility
- Market risks

### 3. Production Manager
**Purpose**: Timelines, milestones, shipping checklist

**Deliverables**:
- Production milestone checklist
- Cost estimates (500/1000/2000 units)
- Timeline estimate
- Risk factors
- Recommended production path

### 4. Playtest Protocol
**Purpose**: Design playtest procedures, feedback frameworks

**Protocols needed**:
1. First playtest (Carlie, private, low-stakes)
2. Blind playtest (strangers, no Omar present)
3. Feedback forms for different player types
4. Success metrics
5. Iteration decision framework

### 5. Art Pipeline Advisor
**Purpose**: AI art workflows, cost estimates, style guides

**Focus**:
- AI-assisted pipeline (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
- Style consistency across 50+ cards
- Printing requirements (300dpi, bleed)
- Cost comparison: AI vs. illustrator
- Component art requirements

## Activation Sequence

| Phase | Activity | Duration |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Document Ingestion | Week 0 |
| 1 | Sacred Core Identification | Week 1 |
| 2 | Parallel Analysis | Weeks 2–3 |
| 3 | Omar Review | Week 3 |
| 4 | Production Planning | Week 4 |
| 5 | Physical Prototype | Weeks 5–6 |

---

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Blocker |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0 - Document Ingestion | ✅ Complete | Wiki built from vault |
| 1 - Sacred Core | ⏳ Ready to start | Needs Omar reflection |
| 2 - Parallel Analysis | 🔒 Locked | Needs Phase 1 |
| 3 - Omar Review | 🔒 Locked | Needs Phase 2 |
| 4 - Production | 🔒 Locked | Needs Phase 3 |
| 5 - Prototype | 🔒 Locked | Needs Phase 4 |

---

## Kill Criteria

- If Carlie doesn't enjoy paper prototype → major redesign
- If market saturated → positioning pivot
- If art pipeline >3 months → simplify visual scope
- If Omar can't commit 2h/week → pause until career stabilizes

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Paper prototype printed by [DATE]
- [ ] Carlie playtest completed by [DATE]
- [ ] Blind playtest protocol ready by [DATE]
- [ ] Publisher pitch deck ready by [DATE]
