# Yumea — The Design Journey

> *A cooperative game about healing through dreams. Three years of iteration, from family promise to near-playable reality.*

## Where We Are

**Health: 6.5/10.** Systems locked. Art at 0%. Perfectionism winning over playtesting.

The core works. Place tiles, build harmony, face nightmares, restore the dreamer. Twelve personas offer genuine strategic variety. The emotional framework — Fear ↔ Courage, Despair ↔ Hope — permeates every system. It's good. It's close. It's been close for a while.

**The blocker isn't design. It's completion.** Component counts are still TBD. Art direction is defined but nothing's produced. I've analyzed replayability to death (7.1/10 → 8.8 potential) instead of printing a prototype.

**Five to six months of focused work** gets this to playtest-ready. The question isn't capability. It's priority and permission to ship something imperfect.

### What Needs to Happen

1. **Lock components.** Tile counts. Token quantities. Card dimensions. Get to a number I can quote to a manufacturer.

2. **Make placeholder art.** Midjourney, Leonardo, whatever works. Twenty nightmares. Twelve personas. Forty blueprints. Ugly is fine. Absent is not.

3. **Print and play.** Three to four players. Blind test. Watch where they struggle, where they light up, where they check out. That data matters more than another balance pass.

## How to Use This Wiki

**Core Systems** — How the game actually works. The loop, the personas, the nightmares, the cards.

**Chronology** — Where this came from. Dreams of Peace, Dreamscapers, Yumea. What changed and why.

**Analysis** — Honest assessment. What's working, what's broken, what's missing, what's risky.

**Philosophy** — Sacred Core, pivot points, open questions. The why behind the what.

**Path to Playable** — Gap analysis. What's actually needed for a first test versus what feels needed.

## 🎯 Project Context

**Yumea** (formerly Dreamscapers) is a cooperative/semi-cooperative tile-placement board game about emotional healing through dreams. Players take on roles as **Dreamscapers** — emotional guardians who help a dreamer navigate their subconscious, building harmonious structures (Anchors) while facing manifestations of inner fears (Nightmares).

### Sacred Core — What Makes Yumea Yumea

These five principles are non-negotiable. Every system, every card, every rule must serve at least one:

![System Overview](diagrams/system-overview.svg)
*The three pillars of Yumea: Dreams, Nightmares, and Anchors in constant flow*

**1. Emotion as Mechanic**
The game doesn't just *have* emotions — it *is* emotions. Tile placement isn't spatial optimization; it's choosing what to build in a psyche. Nightmares aren't enemies to defeat; they're fears to face. Every mechanic must reflect, evoke, or counter a real emotional state.

**2. Cooperative Restoration**
Victory isn't conquest. You don't win by destroying the nightmares — you win by restoring harmony. The dreamer heals. The players support. The metric is wholeness, not dominance.

**3. Symbolic Spatial Design**
The board *is* the mind. Where you place matters emotionally, not just mechanically. Proximity is intimacy. Distance is isolation. The spatial relationships carry symbolic weight.

**4. Accessible Depth**
Jenin can play the family mode at age three. A hobbyist can spend forty hours mastering persona synergies. Same game, different depths. The complexity emerges from the system, not the rules.

**5. Mirrored Emotional Axis**

![Emotional Ecosystem](diagrams/emotional-ecosystem.svg)
*The four mirrored emotional pairs — every nightmare has its counter, every fear its courage*

Every fear has its counter. Fear ↔ Courage. Despair ↔ Hope. Isolation ↔ Connection. Chaos ↔ Balance. Nightmares embody the negative; Anchors embody the positive. The whole game is this tension.

### Why This Matters

Yumea is the game I keep coming back to. Not because it's closest to shipping — it isn't. Not because it's the most commercially viable — who knows. But because it carries weight. I promised my daughters a game about dreams, and this is that promise kept.

Carlie mentioned it a year after she first played. Unprompted. "What happened to that dream game?" That's the signal I trust. If it lands with her, it can land with others.

The problem is perfectionism. I keep refining systems — energy economy tweaks, persona balance passes, anchor scoring refinements — instead of shipping something imperfect that people can actually play. This wiki is partly documentation, partly intervention: identifying what's truly needed for a first playtest versus what I'm doing to avoid the vulnerability of completion.

**The goal:** Ship a working version. Test. Learn. Iterate. Perfect is the enemy of played.
