## Project Context

**Yumea** (formerly Dreamscapers) is a cooperative tile-placement board game about emotional healing through dreams. Players are **Dreamscapers** — emotional guardians building harmonious structures while facing inner fears.

### Sacred Core

**1. Emotion as Mechanic**
Every mechanic reflects, evokes, or counters a real emotional state.

**2. Cooperative Restoration**
Win by restoring harmony, not destroying nightmares.

**3. Symbolic Spatial Design**
The board is the mind. Proximity is intimacy. Distance is isolation.

**4. Accessible Depth**
Family mode (age 8+) to hobbyist depth.

**5. Mirrored Emotional Axis**
Every fear has its counter: Fear/Courage, Despair/Hope, Isolation/Connection, Chaos/Balance.

### Why This Matters

Documented:
- Promise to daughters
- Three years of development
- Carlie's validation a year later: "What happened to that dream game?"
- Health score: 8.55/10 composite (Vision 9.0, Mechanics 8.5, Replayability 7.1)
