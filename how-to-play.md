# How to Play Yumea

> *A step-by-step guide to your first game.*

---

## What You Need

**On the table:**
- Game board (the dreamscape)
- Tile bag with 48 terrain tiles
- Persona cards (choose one each)
- Nightmare deck (3 tiers, shuffled separately)
- Purification deck (80 cards)
- Anchor cards (objectives)
- Tokens: Dream energy (💠), Harmony (🕊️), Tension markers

**Your persona card shows:**
- Core ability (always available)
- Ultimate ability (once per game)
- Affinity bonus (synergy with certain tiles)

---

## Setup (5 Minutes)

1. **Place the board** — center of the table, dreamscape side up
2. **Choose personas** — each player takes one, reads abilities aloud
3. **Shuffle decks** — Nightmares (keep tiers separate), Purification, Anchors
4. **Draw starting hand** — 3 purification cards each
5. **Set Tension to 0** — place marker on the track
6. **Place starting tile** — draw one terrain, place center board
7. **Reveal first Anchor** — draw anchor card, this is your shared goal

**You're ready.**

---

## The Goal

**Restore the dreamer's harmony before the nightmares overwhelm them.**

- **Win:** Complete 3 Anchors (emotional restoration objectives)
- **Lose:** Tension reaches 20, or all personas are corrupted

This is cooperative — you win together or lose together.

---

## Turn Structure

Each turn has 3 phases, in order:

### Phase 1: Place a Tile

Draw a terrain tile from the bag. Place it adjacent to existing tiles.

**Why placement matters:**
- Matching terrain types create harmony chains
- Adjacent tiles activate persona abilities
- Position affects anchor completion

**Example:** You place a Water tile next to an existing Water tile. This creates a harmony chain — mark 1 🕊️ on the harmony track.

---

### Phase 2: Check Tension

If your tile placement created harmony → nothing happens.

If no harmony created → increase Tension by 1.

If Tension crosses a threshold (5, 10, 15) → **Draw a Nightmare.**

**Nightmare cards:**
- **Whispers (1-5 Tension):** Minor effects, easily managed
- **Echoes (6-10 Tension):** Moderate threats, require response
- **Reverberations (11+ Tension):** Serious dangers, can corrupt

Draw from the appropriate tier. Read it aloud. Place it on the board (it covers terrain, blocking harmony there).

---

### Phase 3: Respond

You have 2 action points to spend. Options:

| Action | Cost | What You Do |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Purify** | 1 AP | Play a purification card to remove a Nightmare |
| **Use Ability** | 1 AP | Activate your persona's core ability |
| **Build Anchor** | 2 AP | Spend harmony to progress anchor objective |
| **Support** | 1 AP | Give card/token to another player |
| **Draw Cards** | 1 AP | Draw 2 purification cards |

**Important:** You can discuss with other players. This is cooperative — table talk is encouraged.

---

## Persona Example: The Guardian

**Core Ability — Protective Presence (1 AP)**
> Place a Shield token on any tile. Nightmares cannot enter that tile until your next turn.

**Ultimate — Sanctuary (once per game, free)**
> Remove all Nightmares from one tile and all adjacent tiles. Restore 2 🕊️ harmony.

**Affinity — Stone Tiles**
> When you place a Stone tile, gain +1 💠 energy.

**Playstyle:** Defensive, protective, creates safe zones.

---

## Example Turn

**Sarah plays The Guardian.**

**Phase 1 — Place:** She draws a Stone tile. Places it adjacent to two existing Stone tiles. Creates a 3-tile harmony chain. Gains +1 💠 from affinity. Marks 3 🕊️ on harmony track.

**Phase 2 — Tension:** Harmony was created. No tension increase. No nightmare.

**Phase 3 — Respond (2 AP):**
- Spends 1 AP: Uses Protective Presence. Places Shield on the new Stone tile.
- Spends 1 AP: Supports. Gives a purification card to Mike (The Scholar).

**Turn ends.** Sarah has 0 AP left, 1 💠 energy, 1 card in hand.

---

## Anchors: How to Win

Anchor cards show pattern objectives:
- "3 Water tiles in a triangle"
- "5 tiles total, at least 2 Courage symbols"
- "Path connecting 2 specific tiles"

**To complete an Anchor:**
1. Pattern must exist on the board
2. Spend 2 AP and required harmony (shown on card)
3. Collect the Anchor card (worth victory points)

**First Anchor completed:** Draw new Anchor, increase all persona energy by 1.

**Third Anchor completed:** **You win.**

---

## Nightmares: How You Lose

Nightmares sit on tiles, blocking harmony there. They have effects:

- **Fear** — Players adjacent lose 1 energy
- **Despair** — Cannot play cards with Hope symbols
- **Isolation** — Adjacent tiles don't count as adjacent
- **Chaos** — Random tile flips to opposite side

**Removing Nightmares:**
- Purification cards (matching the Nightmare's emotion)
- Certain persona abilities
- Completing Anchors (removes all Nightmares from completed pattern)

**Corruption:** If a Nightmare stays on the board 3 full rounds, it corrupts. Corrupted tiles are permanently damaged — no harmony, no abilities work there.

---

## Winning & Losing

**Victory:**
- Complete 3 Anchors
- Emotional restoration achieved
- The dreamer wakes healed

**Defeat (any of these):**
- Tension reaches 20
- All personas have 0 energy simultaneously
- 5+ tiles corrupted
- Decks run out (rare, but possible)

---

## First Game Tips

1. **Communicate constantly** — Tell other players what you need
2. **Prioritize anchors** — They're the only path to victory
3. **Don't ignore nightmares** — They get worse if left alone
4. **Use your ultimate** — It's powerful, don't save it for "perfect" moment
5. **Remember: you're a team** — Cards, energy, ideas are shared resources

---

## Family Mode (Simpler)

For younger players or first games:
- Remove Reverberations (tier 3 nightmares)
- Start with 4 energy instead of 2
- Corruption takes 5 rounds instead of 3
- Nightmares have no ongoing effects (just block tiles)

Keep the core experience, reduce complexity.
