**Sacred Core Preserved**
All systems remained; branding evolution only

  - Vision: 9.0/10
  - Mechanics: 8.5/10
  - Replayability: 7.1/10

**Key Finding**: Gap between design and assets; perfectionism pattern identified

**The Blocker Named**
"Seal before assets" trap: systems never feel sealed because standards rise

## System Evolution Log

### Energy Economy

| Version | Rule | Change Reason |
|---------|------|---------------|
| v0.2 | 1 💠/turn baseline | Too restrictive |
| v0.2b | 1.3 💠/player/turn | Scaling for player count |
| v0.3 | Cap raised 3→5 | Storage for big plays |
| v0.3b | Scaling considerations | Solo vs group balance |

### End Condition

| Version | Trigger | Change Reason |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| v0.2 | Turn-limited (X turns) | Anticlimactic endings |
| v0.3 | Boss defeat OR collapse | Narrative closure |

### Persona Balance

| Version | Issue | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| v0.2 | Trickster >>> Envoy | PVU grid tuning needed |
| v0.2 | Some personas passive | Synergy system added v0.3 |
| v0.3 | Ultimate ability variance | Scoring grid formalized |

## Key Relationships

### Family Validation
- **Carlie**: Unprompted validation a year later — "brilliant" concept
- **Jenin**: Dream song connection — emotional origin
- **Pattern**: Intimate user testing before market validation

### Dependencies
- **AMDI**: Potential confidence builder (lower emotional investment)
- **Foundry**: Competing priority (career/revenue focus)
