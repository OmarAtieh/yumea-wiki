## Phase 1: Early Development (2023)

### v0.1 — "Dreams of Peace" (2023)

**Context**: Omar's personal project. Carlie told him about her dreams every morning, bringing the topic to the foreground. Combined with having children and fascination with game design, the seed emerged: something to play with wife and kids, and share passion with the world. Early sketches of homemade games from childhood reimagined for family play.

**What Was Introduced**:
- Core concept: Dreams as a board game theme
- Early tile placement mechanics
- Emotional undertones (safety, wonder, courage)
- Personal/family validation pattern established — "games for loved ones first, strangers second"

**What Was Working**:
- Emotional resonance with family (Jenin's dream song connection)
- Whimsical, storybook aesthetic direction
- Cooperative foundation

**What Failed/Changed**:
- Name didn't capture the "scaping" aspect of building dreams
- Mechanics too simple for hobbyist appeal
- Lack of tension/pacing structure

**Why Changes Happened**: Needed to bridge emotional accessibility with strategic depth.

## Phase 2: Mid Development (2024)

### v0.2 — Dreamscapers Framework (2024)

**Major Shift**: Formalized game design structure; 12 personas defined; emotional framework locked.

**What Was Introduced**:
- **12 Unique Personas**: Each with core, ultimate, and affinity bonuses
- **Mirrored Emotional Axis**: Fear–Courage, Despair–Hope, Isolation–Connection, Chaos–Balance
- **Lexicon-First Design**: Emotional keywords as organizing principle
- **Tile System**: Hex-based terrain with harmony mechanics
- **Nightmare System**: Three-tier threat structure (Whispers → Echoes → Reverberations)
- **Blueprint/Anchor System**: Spatial pattern-building for emotional restoration
- **Purification Deck**: 80-card restorative memory system
- **Tension Deck**: Escalation mechanics via deck trimming
- **Art Direction Manual**: Full visual language, color palettes, emotional mapping

**What Was Working**:
- Emotional-systemic integration praised as "genuinely innovative"
- Persona matrix covered diverse playstyles (Support, Economy, Builder, Foresight, Wildcard)
- Modular onboarding options (family mode, hard mode)
- Visual-symbolic integrity: "The board is the dreamer's mind"

**What Failed/Needed Work**:
- Some personas (Envoy) felt passive in competitive variants
- Ultimate ability balance uneven (Trickster >>> Envoy)
- Token/UI burden at 4–6 players
- Early turns too "quiet" in larger games
- First-time blueprint selection overwhelming

**Why Changes Happened**:
- Playtesting feedback revealed AP-prone complexity
- Need for clearer onboarding without sacrificing depth
- Market positioning required differentiation from Spirit Island, Cascadia

---

## Phase 3: Current State (Early–Mid 2025)

### v0.3 — Yumea Rebrand (2025)

**Major Shift**: Name change to Yumea; consolidation of systems; preparation for production.

**What Was Introduced**:
- **Name Change**: Yumea (more resonant, easier to trademark, culturally neutral)
- **Hybrid Tile/Anchor System**: Refined blueprint completion rules; token linking
- **Dream Energy Economy**: 1.3 💠/player/turn baseline; storage cap of 5 (solo) scaling considerations
- **Tension Difficulty Scaling**: Levels 1–5 via deck compression and spawn ratios
- **Persona Emotional Synergy**: +1 purification token when countering nightmare's emotion
- **Anchor Reward Framework**: Tier III bonuses (Empowerment, Fray Delay, Memory Reclaimed)
- **Dream Phase Zones**: Fog → Emergence → Resonance progression
- **Dreamer Journal Campaigns**: Narrative-linked multi-session play
- **Communal Goals**: Team coordination objectives (under development)
- **Replayability Framework**: Stonemaier Framework application (current score: 7.1/10, target 8.8–9.3)

**What Was Changed**:
- Energy retention cap raised from 3 to 5 (with scaling considerations)
- Purification draw standardized: 1 card/turn, discard to hand limit
- Scholar rework: Double energy from earned sources (not per turn draw)
- Game end trigger: No longer turn-limited; ends on boss defeat or collapse
- Anchor harmony scaling formalized: Small (1×), Medium (1.5×), Large (2× tile requirements)

**What Was Removed**:
- "Dream Shapers" name option (kept Dreamscapers as legacy, Yumea as current)
- Global cleansing effects (non-thematic)
- Dream phase skip mechanics (broke pacing design)
- Some overly complex anchor ownership rules (simplified to "finisher gets credit")

**What Was Working**:
- GDD v0.7.1 at 75%+ complete
- Emotional framework permeates all systems (9.0/10 Vision & Coherence)
- Market differentiation clear: "Spirit Island meets Dixit's heart"
- Carlie's validation persists (unprompted mention a year later)

**Current Blockers**:
- **Asset Production**: 0% executed art despite 90% defined direction
- **Component Counts**: Still "TBD" — blocks manufacturer quotes
- **GDD Duplication**: Turn structure appears in multiple sections
- **Playtest Gap**: No blind testing yet; refinement without reality contact
- **Perfectionism Pattern**: "Seal before assets" trap — systems never feel sealed

---

## Phase 4: Target State (Late 2025)

### v0.4 — Playtest-Ready (Target: Q2 2025)

**Goals**:
- Print-and-play kit available
- Placeholder art for all components
- First blind playtests completed
- Component counts locked
- 12 goal cards drafted

### v1.0 — Production-Ready (Target: Q4 2025)

**Goals**:
- Final art integrated
- Rulebook complete
- Publisher pitch OR Kickstarter ready
- Manufacturing quotes secured

## Key Pivot Points

### 1. From "Dreams of Peace" to Dreamscapers
- **When**: 2024
- **Why**: Needed clearer mechanical identity; "scapers" implies active construction
- **Sacred Core Preserved**: Emotional healing, family-first design

### 2. From Dreamscapers to Yumea
- **When**: Early 2025
- **Why**: Easier pronunciation, trademark availability, more evocative
- **Sacred Core Preserved**: All systems remained; branding evolution only

### 3. From Pure Tile Placement to Hybrid Tile/Anchor
- **When**: Mid-2025
- **Why**: Added strategic depth without complexity bloat; spatial patterning more satisfying
- **Risk**: Token sprawl at high player counts (mitigation: dual-layer board overlays planned)

### 4. From Turn-Limited to Boss/Climax Resolution
- **When**: May 2025
- **Why**: Anticlimactic endings undermined emotional arc; narrative closure required
- **Trade-off**: Longer games, but more satisfying conclusions

## Lessons from Chronology

1. **Emotional Core Never Changed**: From 2023 to 2025, the focus on family play and healing remained constant
2. **Names Evolve, Systems Consolidate**: External branding changed; internal systems refined but preserved
3. **Perfectionism is the Enemy**: Multiple iterations on energy caps, draw rules, anchor scoring — all refinements without playtest data
4. **Validation Pattern**: Carlie's approval as north star; market signals secondary to intimate user testing
5. **Digital/Modular Strategy**: Relocation necessitated digital-first prototyping; aligns with Tabletop Simulator path
