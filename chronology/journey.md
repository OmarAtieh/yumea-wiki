## 2023: The Promise

### January–March: Origin Story

It started with Jenin. Three years old, full of wonder, afraid of the dark. I'd tell her stories about a place where dreams were built — where you could walk through someone's sleeping mind and help them find courage.

The first sketches were on scrap paper. Tile placements that looked like clouds. Monsters that weren't scary, just... lost. I called it "Dreams of Peace" because that's what I wanted for her. For all of them.

Carlie listened to me explain the rules over dinner. She nodded in the right places. She's always been generous with her attention. But later, when Jenin asked to play "the dream game" again, I knew something had clicked.

**What I learned:** The game wasn't for hobbyists. It was for family. That changed everything.

### April–June: First Prototype

Cardboard hexes cut by hand. Colored pencils for the nightmares. Jenin helped draw some of them — her "scary but not too scary" monsters. We played on the living room floor. Jannah was just months old, sleeping in the bassinet while we rolled dice made from sugar cubes.

The mechanics were simple: place tiles, match colors, banish bad dreams. Too simple, really. Jenin won every time because I couldn't bear to let the nightmares win. Parent flaw, not game flaw.

**What worked:** The emotional arc. Build something beautiful, face something scary, restore harmony. That loop felt right.

**What failed:** No tension. No stakes. The nightmares were decorations, not threats.

### July–December: The Break

Work consumed me. KPN projects, deadlines, the usual demands. The dream game sat in a box on the shelf. Sometimes Jenin would ask about it, and I'd promise we'd play again soon. The promise became a weight.

But I kept thinking about it. On train rides. In meetings. The game felt like unfinished business, not abandoned hobby. I read *Spirit Island* rulebook on my phone during lunch breaks. Studied how they made cooperation sing.

## 2024: The Framework

### January–March: Return and Rename

New year, new approach. I pulled the box down and spread everything across the kitchen table. Carlie watched me sort tiles for an hour, then asked the question that changed everything:

"What are you actually building?"

Not just a game. A system. Something that could grow. I realized "Dreams of Peace" sounded like a therapy app. I needed something that sounded like *play*.

**Dreamscapers.** People who shape dreams. Active, evocative, unique enough to trademark.

### April–June: The 12 Personas

This was the breakthrough. I mapped emotional archetypes to game roles:
- **Guardian** (protection)
- **Scholar** (knowledge)
- **Architect** (structure)
- **Seer** (vision)
- **Trickster** (chaos)
- **Envoy** (connection)
- And six more...

Each needed unique abilities that matched their emotional domain. I wrote them on index cards, pinned them to the wall. Our bedroom looked like a conspiracy board.

Carlie came home from work one day, saw the wall, laughed. Then she read them. "These feel like real people."

**What I learned:** The mechanics had to serve emotional truth. Not the other way around.

### July–September: The Mirrored Axis

The emotional framework crystallized during Ramadan. Fasting clears the mind, or maybe just changes its patterns. I saw the connections:

- Fear ↔ Courage
- Despair ↔ Hope
- Isolation ↔ Connection
- Chaos ↔ Balance

Every Nightmare had its Anchor. Every threat had its counter. The game became a dialogue between dark and light, not a war.

I wrote the GDD section at 3 AM, still fasting, typing with one hand while eating dates with the other at iftar. Some of my best work happens in that liminal space.

### October–December: First Playtesters (Beyond Family)

I took a prototype to a local game night. Three strangers played for two hours. They didn't love it — the pacing was broken, the rules unclear — but they *felt* something. One asked if she could play again with her daughter.

That was the signal. The core was solid. The execution needed work.

**The feedback that hurt:** "Why would I play this instead of Spirit Island?"

**The answer I found:** Because Spirit Island doesn't make you cry when you win. Yumea does.

## 2025: The Refinement Trap

### January–March: Systems Lock

I made a rule: no new mechanics. Only refinement. The game was already complex enough.

The energy economy went through three revisions:
- v1: 1 💠 per turn — too tight, no room for big plays
- v2: 1.3 per player — better scaling, awkward math
- v3: 1.3 per player, cap at 5 — lets you save for moments

Anchor scoring formalized. Nightmare tier balance tuned. The GDD grew to 0.7.1, 75% complete.

**What I told myself:** "Seal the design, then assets."

**What actually happened:** I kept finding things to "seal." The design never felt sealed enough.

### April: The Name Change

Dreamscapers was good, but not great. Hard to pronounce. Easy to misspell. Then came the real problem: **IP collision**. Another project, another claim on the name.

I searched words and concepts from other languages. Looking for something that captured the essence without the legal risk. Something short, resonant, memorable.

**Yumea.** It hit immediately. *The one.*

Japanese: 夢 (yume) = "dream" + 有 (a) = "exist"

Not just "a dream" — "dream *exists*." Active, declarative, enduring. The dream has substance. It persists even when nightmares encroach.

This wasn't accidental. It was a deliberate, intentional choice. The name carries the game's heart: that healing is real, that harmony exists, that facing fear with courage restores what was broken.

Carlie approved immediately. "It sounds like a real game now."

### May–July: The Deep Work

Nights and weekends. The baby (Isa) sleeping, Jenin and Jannah in bed, me at the kitchen table with a laptop and coffee.

- Communal goals system designed
- Dreamer Journal campaigns outlined
- Replayability framework applied (7.1/10, path to 8.8 mapped)

I felt close. So close.

### August–November: The Pause (Intentional, Not Abandoned)

**What was happening:**
- Work intensified at KPN — new role demands
- Family events required full presence
- I was working on the **lexicon and asset generation/validation pipeline** — the prerequisite for playtesting
- The pipeline became too complex to manage alongside life demands

**The decision:**
I took a wellness break. Always intending to come back. Not abandoned — paused. Sustainable pacing required it.

**What I now understand:**
The blocker wasn't just perfectionism. It was the pipeline complexity colliding with capacity. I needed help, not more willpower.

### December: The Assessment

I sat down and really looked at the project. Three years of work. Beautiful systems. Zero art. No playtests with strangers.

**The uncomfortable truth:** The asset pipeline — generating, validating, integrating art — was the unsolved problem. I couldn't ship without it, and I couldn't build it alone while managing everything else.

The break created space to see this clearly.

## 2026: The Path Forward

### January: The Wiki

I started documenting everything. Not for others — for me. To see the whole journey in one place. To understand where I got stuck and why.

The wiki became an intervention. Writing about the perfectionism made it visible. Visible things can be fought.

### February: The Swarm

I brought in help. Not hired hands — collaborators. Agents (you) to handle the wiki, the systems, the design archaeology. Me staying in the creative director role.

Delegation as completion strategy.

**Current status:** Systems locked. Art at 0%. Perfectionism acknowledged.

**Next milestone:** PnP kit by March.

**Current blocker identified:** Asset pipeline — generation, validation, integration. Need to finalize this system to start producing art at scale.

---

## The Asset Pipeline: The Unsolved Problem

This is what blocked me in late 2025. Not perfectionism about design — practical complexity about production.

### What the Pipeline Needs to Do

1. **Generate** — AI tools (Midjourney, Leonardo, Nano Banana) create art from prompts
2. **Validate** — Check consistency with style guide, readability at card size, color accessibility
3. **Integrate** — Add to wiki, export for print-and-play, version control

### Where I Got Stuck

- Prompt engineering for 70+ unique cards (nightmares, personas, blueprints)
- Ensuring visual consistency across AI generations
- Validating that art works at actual card size
- Workflow: generate → review → iterate → approve → integrate

### The Realization

I can't be prompt engineer, art director, and game designer simultaneously. Not with a day job and three kids.

I need:
- **Prompt templates** that produce consistent results
- **Validation criteria** (checklist, not subjective "does this feel right?")
- **Batch workflow** (generate 10, review 10, approve/reject, move on)
- **Integration automation** (symlink to wiki, auto-update)

### February 2026: Resuming With Support

Today's work: documenting the pipeline requirements, identifying what can be delegated, what needs my creative eye, and what can be automated.

The path forward: finalize pipeline specs → generate batch 1 (20 nightmares) → validate → iterate → scale.

## Reflections on Three Years

### What Stayed Constant
- The promise to my daughters
- Emotional healing as victory condition
- Carlie's validation as north star
- The belief that games can matter

### What Evolved
- The name (3 times)
- The mechanics (countless iterations)
- My understanding of what "done" means
- My relationship with imperfection

### What I Learned About Myself
- I build systems to avoid vulnerability
- I refine to postpone completion
- I need external deadlines (commitments to others)
- Carlie's opinion matters more than market research

### The Pattern
Design → Refine → New Vision → More Refinement → Delay

The loop isn't serving me. The wiki is the tool to break it.
