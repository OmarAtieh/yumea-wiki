## What's Blocking 🔒

### Critical Path

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Art Assets 0% | Can't prototype | AI pipeline + batch generation |
| "Seal before assets" | Psychological | Wiki completion → PnP kit |
| No playtests | Unknown fun factor | Carlie playtest → blind tests |
| Component counts TBD | Can't quote manufacturing | Finalize during PnP |

### Content Gaps

- [ ] Communal Goals Deck (missing entirely)
- [ ] Additional Blueprints (12–20 needed)
- [ ] Goal Card Expansion (12→20+)
- [ ] Nightmare Variants (expansion content)

### System Gaps

- [ ] Engine Building Depth (delayed triggers, scaling anchors)
- [ ] Combo Systems (blueprint-bonus interactions)
- [ ] Social Dynamics (whisper mechanics, voting)

## The Perfectionism Pattern (Reframed)

**Not perfectionism. Commitment to coherence.**

The trap: Systems feel incomplete because assets don't match vision → Assets can't be produced until systems feel sealed → Loop continues.

**Solution**: Documentation as intervention. Crystallize what's done, make gaps visible, ship ugly prototype.

## Sacred Core (Immutable)

> "What would I NOT change even if playtesters hated it?"

1. **Emotion-as-Mechanic**: Every system serves emotional truth
2. **Cooperative Restoration**: Not conquest, healing
3. **Symbolic Spatial Design**: Board represents psychological landscape
4. **Family Accessibility**: Jenin plays, gamers appreciate
