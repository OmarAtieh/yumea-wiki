# Yumea Current Systems (Locked v0.7)

> *As of February 2026 — What was actually adopted vs. explored*

---

## Critical Correction

**Previously documented:** Original separate Nightmare + Tension systems  
**Actually adopted:** Combined Deck System (v2.0)

The wiki audit had an error — the tension/nightmare mechanics use the **combined deck system**, not the original separate systems.

## Nightmare & Tension System (ADOPTED: Combined Deck v2.0)

### Deck Structure

| Card Type | Count | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Minor Cards** | Majority | Small negative effects, dream destabilization |
| **Major Cards** | ~8-12 | Nightmare spawn + escalation effect |
| **Final Card** | 1 | Triggers phase change |

### Game Flow: 3 Phases

| Phase | Deck State | Tension Level |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1** | Full deck | Low threat, building |
| **Phase 2** | Post-reshuffle, trimmed | Escalating, more Major cards |
| **Phase 3** | Highly trimmed | Climactic, Final Surge approaches |

### Key Mechanics

**Shrinking Deck System:**
- After each reshuffle, remove Minor cards
- Major card frequency increases naturally
- Creates organic tension escalation

**Nightmare Spawn Deck (Separate):**
- Provides variety in which nightmares appear
- Not the primary pacing mechanism
- Complements the tension deck

**Board Size:**
- Fixed board creates predictable game window
- Prevents open-endedness
- Game ends when board fills or Final Surge resolves

**Predictable Window:**
- ~60-90 minutes based on board size
- No "stalling" incentive — deck advances per turn
- Consistent arc: Incubation → Instability → Climax

## What Was Explored But NOT Adopted

### Original Separate Systems (April 2025)
- **Nightmare Spawn:** d6 roll on tile placement (16.7% chance)
- **Tension Triggers:** Nightmare spawn, disharmonious tile, etc.
- **Tension Deck:** 20 Minor + 5 Surge + 1 Final Surge

**Why rejected:** Too many trigger conditions, cognitive overhead, pacing inconsistencies

### Modular Persona System (May 2025)
- Blank slate personas + ability cards
- 3-5 slots, draft-based acquisition
- Emotion resonance points

**Why rejected:** Too complex, diluted emotional clarity, family accessibility concerns
