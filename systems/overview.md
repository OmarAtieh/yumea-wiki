## The Sacred Core

Three principles that define Yumea:

### 1. Emotion-as-Mechanic
Every system serves an emotional truth:
- Tile placement = building in someone's psyche
- Nightmares = fears to face, not enemies to defeat
- Harmony = restoration, not optimization

### 2. Cooperative Restoration
- Victory through building, not destroying
- Players support each other through abilities
- Win condition: enough harmony to heal

### 3. Symbolic Spatial Design
- Proximity = intimacy
- Distance = isolation
- Board layout = psychological landscape
