### 2. The Scholar (Foresight Archetype)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Emotion** | Balance (🌀) |
| **Playstyle** | Card draw, knowledge advantage |
| **Core Ability** | Double dream energy from all earned sources |
| **Ultimate** | Look at top 3 tiles; draw 2, discard 1 to bottom |
| **Balance Status** | ⚠️ Revised; previously "draw 2 purification" — now energy-focused |

| **Playstyle** | Energy generation, resource acceleration |

## Open Questions

1. **Envoy Buff**: Is "two exchanges" enough, or does it need additional effect?
2. **Dreamweaver Cap**: Should harmony-per-turn caps apply to tile swaps?
3. **New Personas**: Expansion potential for 6–10 additional personas?
4. **Persona-Nightmare Link**: Should personas have "nemesis" nightmare types?
