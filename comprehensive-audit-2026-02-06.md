## Executive Summary

| Dimension | Status | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Core Systems** | ✅ Locked | 9.0/10 | GDD v0.7 complete, no changes since Apr 2025 |
| **Content** | ✅ Complete | 8.5/10 | Cards, blueprints, personas defined |
| **Balance Framework** | ✅ Designed | 8.0/10 | PVU grid established, needs population |
| **Asset Pipeline** | ⚠️ Designed only | 2.0/10 | Prompts ready, 0% generation done |
| **Playability** | ❌ Blocked | 0/10 | No PnP, no playtests |
| **Overall Health** | 🟡 Pre-production | 6.5/10 | Systems ready, execution blocked |

**Critical Finding:** The game is ~85% complete on paper but 0% in physical reality. The asset pipeline is the sole blocker.

### 1.2 Personas — VERIFIED (12 Defined)

| Persona | Role | Power Tier | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| Scholar | Resource anchor | Tier 1 (Beginner) | ✅ Locked |
| Architect | Tile expansion | Tier 1 (Beginner) | ✅ Locked |

**Missing:** PVU grid population for all 12 personas.

---

### 1.3 Nightmares — VERIFIED (30 Cards)

| Tier | Count | Status | Power Range |

| Whispers (Tier 1) | 10 | ✅ Locked | 8-12 attribute pts |
| Echoes (Tier 2) | 12 | ✅ Locked | 13-17 attribute pts |
| Reverberations (Tier 3) | 8+ | ✅ Locked | 18-25 attribute pts |

**Emotion Distribution:**
- Fear 🕷️ | Despair 🌫️ | Isolation 🪞 | Chaos 🔥
- All nightmares tagged with primary + secondary emotions
- Emotion-tuned modifiers designed (behavioral, not numerical)

**Missing:** Actual card art, final naming, playtest validation.

---

### 1.4 Cards & Content — VERIFIED

| Deck | Count | Status | Gap Analysis |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Purification | 80 | ✅ Complete | Sufficient for base game |
| Nightmares | 30 | ✅ Complete | Sufficient for base game |
| Goal Cards | 12 | ⚠️ Minimum | Recommend 20+ for replayability |
| Blueprints/Anchors | ~40 | ✅ Framework | 12 core + 28 expansion-ready |
| Tension Cards | Undefined | ⚠️ Designed | Needs final population |

**Replayability Risk:** Goal deck (12 cards) will exhaust quickly. Expansion to 20+ recommended per replayability analysis.

---

## 2. Balance Framework Audit (PVU System)

### 2.1 PVU Grid Status

**Definition:** Persona Value Unit — 3-axis balance metric
- **P**otential: Maximum impact ceiling
- **V**ariance: Swinginess/range of outcomes
- **U**niqueness: Distinctiveness vs. other assets

**Status:** ✅ Framework designed, ❌ Not populated

**Process Defined:**
1. Axis calibration (1-5 scale)
2. Asset plotting per family
3. Heat-map review (clusters vs. voids)
4. Gap ideation
5. Prototype playtest
6. Re-score & validate
7. Sensitivity review (family/culture/religion/language)
8. Lock & commit

**Missing:** Actual scoring of existing assets.

---

### 2.2 Known Balance Issues (From Replayability Analysis)

| Issue | Severity | Recommended Fix |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Envoy feels passive | Medium | PVU grid tuning |

| Trickster variance high | Low | Acceptable for Tier 3 |
| Some ultimates stronger than others | Medium | PVU pass needed |
| Goal card pool small | Medium | Expand 12→20+ |

**Priority:** Low — balance tuning happens post-first-playtest.

---

### 2.3 Tier Framework — VERIFIED

| Tier | Applies To | Magnitude |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Intro/Whisper/Small | Early game, teaching | 8-12 pts, 2-3 tiles |

## 7. Path to Playable State

### 7.1 Fast Path (Recommended): 4 Weeks

**Week 1: Asset Generation Sprint**
- Generate Batch 1: 10 Nightmares (Whispers)
- Validate workflow, refine prompts
- Generate Batch 2: 10 Nightmares (Echoes)

**Week 2: Persona Art**
- Generate Batch 3: 12 Personas
- Create placeholder terrain tiles (color blocks acceptable)

**Week 3: PnP Assembly**
- Lock component counts
- Create print-ready PDFs
- Print at home, cut, sleeve

**Week 4: First Playtest**
- Play with Carlie
- Document issues, fun moments, confusion points
- Iterate based on feedback

**Outcome:** Playable greybox prototype.

---

### 7.2 Quality Path: 8-12 Weeks

Same as Fast Path, but:
- Higher quality art (more prompt iteration)
- Full PVU grid population before playtest
- Balance pass on personas
- Expanded goal deck (20 cards)
- Defined tension deck
- Blind playtests with strangers

**Outcome:** Publisher-ready prototype.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Choose path:** Fast (4 weeks) vs. Quality (8-12 weeks)
2. **Generate Batch 1:** 10 Nightmares, validate pipeline
3. **Lock component counts:** Essential for PnP

### Short-term (Next 4 Weeks)

1. Complete all art batches
2. Assemble PnP kit
3. First playtest with Carlie
4. Document feedback

### Medium-term (Next 3 Months)

1. Iterate based on playtests
2. Populate PVU grid
3. Expand goal deck
4. Prepare publisher pitch OR Kickstarter

---

## 9. Conclusion

**The Good:**
- Systems are locked, elegant, and emotionally coherent
- Design framework is industry-leading in sophistication
- Content is complete and ready for production
- Quality assurance processes are comprehensive

**The Bad:**
- 150+ art assets needed, 0 generated
- No physical prototype exists
- No playtest data
- 1 year of pause has created momentum loss

**The Path Forward:**
The game is ~85% complete on paper but 0% in reality. The ONLY blocker is asset generation. The pipeline is designed — it just needs execution.

**My Recommendation:** Take the Fast Path. Generate placeholder art, print a PnP, playtest with Carlie. Momentum matters more than perfection at this stage.
