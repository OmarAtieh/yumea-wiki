## What's Locked (v0.7)

**Game**: Cooperative tile-placement. Place tiles, build harmony, face nightmares, complete anchors. Win by finishing 3 anchors or defeating Boss.

**12 Personas**: Scholar, Architect, Dreamweaver, Brave, Child, Pathfinder, Visionary, Trickster, Artisan, Conduit, Envoy, Bloom.

**Core Loop**: Draw tile → Place → Gain harmony/energy → Face nightmares → Purify or build anchors.

**Economy**: 1.3 💠/player/turn, cap at 5.

**Nightmares**: 3 tiers via Combined Deck system.

**Win**: Complete 3 Anchors OR Boss defeat.

## Asset Pipeline Status

**Designed:**
- Art direction (style, colors)
- Prompt templates
- Validation criteria
- Production schedule (Batches 1–5)
- Workflow: Generate → Validate → Integrate

**Not Implemented:**
- No images generated
- No automation scripts
- No physical prototype

**Documented Reason for Pause:**
Per STATE_SNAPSHOT_2026-02-06: "Pipeline complexity exceeded capacity. Life demands intensified. Intentional wellness break — always intended to return."

## Path Options

### Path A: Fast to Playtest

**Goal**: PnP kit by end of February.

1. Week 1: Generate placeholder art (Batch 1: 10 Nightmares)
2. Week 2: Continue generation (Batches 2-3)
3. Week 3: PnP assembly
4. Week 4: First playtest

### Path B: Production-Quality First

**Goal**: Publisher-ready assets.

1. Month 1: Finalize pipeline, refine prompts
2. Month 2: Full production (50+ images)
3. Month 3: Polish & playtest

**Risk**: Longer to feedback, potential perfectionism loop.

## Decisions Needed

1. Component counts (tiles, tokens, cards)
2. PnP scope (minimum vs. complete)
3. Art tools (Midjourney, Leonardo, etc.)
4. Validation workflow (approval process)
5. Target date for first playtest
