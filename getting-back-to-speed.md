# Yumea — Getting Back to Speed

> *You stepped away. Here's what you need to know to jump back in.*

---

## The Bottom Line

**Yumea is closer than it feels.** Systems locked in April 2025 are still locked. Nothing has drifted. The only thing between now and playtesting is **art asset production**.

| Reality | Emotion |
|---------|---------|
| Systems: 100% done | 😌 Secure |
| Content: 100% done | 😌 Secure |
| Art: 0% done | 😰 The blocker |
| Playtesting: Not started | 😰 Because no art |
| Time away: 1 year | 😰 Feels like more |
| Actual work remaining: ~2 months focused | 😌 Manageable |

## Quick Refresh: What's Locked (v0.7)

**The Game**: Cooperative tile-placement. Place tiles, build harmony, face nightmares, complete anchors. Win by finishing 3 anchors before corruption overwhelms.

**12 Personas**: Scholar, Architect, Dreamweaver, Brave, Child, Pathfinder, Visionary, Trickster, Artisan, Conduit, Envoy, Bloom. Each has core ability + ultimate.

**Core Loop**: Draw tile → Place → Gain harmony/energy → Face nightmares → Purify or build anchors.

**Economy**: 1.3 💠/player/turn, cap at 5. Harmony (🕊️) is scoring/currency.

**Nightmares**: 3 tiers (Whispers/Echoes/Reverberations). 30 cards. Corruption spreads.

**Win**: Complete 3 Anchors (pattern objectives) OR defeat Boss.

## The Only Blocker: Asset Pipeline

**Status**: Designed, not implemented.

**What exists**:
- Art direction (style, colors, mood)
- Prompt templates
- Validation criteria
- Production schedule (Batches 1–5)
- Workflow design (Generate → Validate → Integrate)

**What doesn't exist**:
- A single generated image
- Automation scripts
- Any physical prototype

**Why it blocked you**: Pipeline complexity exceeded capacity while life demands intensified. You took an intentional wellness break with every intention to return.

**Why it's solvable now**: The pipeline is designed. You just need to run it.

## What To Do Next (Choose Your Path)

### Path A: Fast to Playtest (Recommended)

**Goal**: PnP kit by end of February.

1. **Week 1**: Generate placeholder art
   - Use Midjourney/Leonardo with existing prompts
   - Batch 1: 10 Nightmares (test workflow)
   - Don't aim for perfect. Aim for "recognizable."

2. **Week 2**: Continue batch generation
   - Batch 2: 10 more Nightmares
   - Batch 3: 12 Personas

3. **Week 3**: Print & Play assembly
   - Lock component counts
   - Create print-ready PDFs
   - Print at home

4. **Week 4**: First playtest (Carlie)
   - Observe, take notes
   - Identify fun-killers vs. minor polish

**Trade-off**: Ugly art, fast feedback.

---

### Path B: Production-Quality Art First

**Goal**: Publisher-ready assets.

1. **Month 1**: Finalize pipeline
   - Refine prompts to 90%+ consistency
   - Build automation scripts
   - Establish validation workflow

2. **Month 2**: Full production
   - Generate all 50+ card images
   - Manual review and curation
   - Integrate into wiki/PnP

3. **Month 3**: Polish & playtest

**Trade-off**: Beautiful art, slower to feedback.

**Risk**: Perfectionism loop ("seal before assets" trap).

---

## Critical Decisions Needed

**Pick one now**:

1. **Component counts**: How many tiles? Tokens? Cards? (Needed for PnP and manufacturer quotes)

2. **PnP scope**: Minimum viable prototype vs. complete experience?

3. **Art tool**: Midjourney primary? Leonardo backup? Both?

4. **Validation**: Do you approve every image, or can Najm pre-filter?

5. **Timeline**: Target date for first blind playtest?

## The Psychological Block

**Pattern**: You build systems to avoid completion. The asset pipeline became complex enough to justify delay.

**Truth**: The game is good. Carlie's validation matters. The promise to Jenin matters. Thousands of hours matter.

**Permission**: Ship ugly. Iterate. The first prototype isn't the final game.

---

## One Action (Right Now)

Choose:
- **A**: Start Batch 1 art generation (10 Nightmares)
- **B**: Lock component counts (15-minute decision)
- **C**: Schedule first playtest date (commitment device)
