# What is Yumea?

> *A cooperative board game about healing through dreams. Three years in the making. A promise to my daughters.*

---

## In One Sentence

Yumea is a cooperative tile-placement game where players become **Dreamscapers** — emotional guardians who build harmonious structures in a dreamer's subconscious while facing manifestations of their inner fears.

---

## What Makes It Different

**Emotion as Mechanic**

Most games have emotions as theme. Yumea has emotions as *system*. Every mechanic serves an emotional truth:
- Tile placement isn't spatial optimization — it's choosing what to build in someone's psyche
- Nightmares aren't enemies to defeat — they're fears to face with courage
- Harmony isn't points — it's the restoration of emotional balance

**The Mirrored Axis**
Every fear has its counter:
- Fear ↔ Courage
- Despair ↔ Hope
- Isolation ↔ Connection
- Chaos ↔ Balance

The game is this tension. You don't win by destroying nightmares. You win by restoring harmony.

**The Board is the Mind**
Spatial relationships carry emotional weight. Proximity is intimacy. Distance is isolation. The physical layout of tiles represents the psychological landscape.

## Who It's For

**Families**
Jenin (3) plays the family mode. The cooperative nature, the gentle art direction, the emotional scaffolding — it works for children. The warmth between players mirrors the game's theme.

**Hobbyist Gamers**
Twelve unique personas with distinct abilities. Engine-building through anchor completion. Strategic depth that reveals itself over multiple plays. This isn't a children's game that adults tolerate. It's a gamer's game that children can access.

**Emotional Players**
If you cried at the end of *Spirit Island*, Yumea is for you. Victory feels like healing. Not conquest. Not dominance. Restoration.

## The Experience

**Setup (5 minutes)**
A dreamscape board. Tiles in a bag. Nightmare deck shuffled. Each player chooses a persona — Guardian, Scholar, Architect, Seer, Trickster, Envoy, and six more. Each brings different strengths to the dream.

**The Flow (60-90 minutes)**
- **Place a tile** — Build the dreamscape, create harmony through connections
- **Face the nightmare** — Draw a card. Whispers. Echoes. Reverberations. Each tier more serious.
- **Respond together** — Use abilities, play purification cards, support each other
- **Build anchors** — Complete emotional patterns that restore the dreamer's core

**The Climax**
The board fills. Tension escalates. Nightmares stack. The final turns feel desperate — then triumphant. When you win, it's not because you destroyed anything. It's because you built enough harmony to heal.

## The Name

**Yumea** (夢有) — Japanese for "dream exists."

The original name was **Dreamscapers**. But IP collisions forced reconsideration. I searched words and concepts from other languages, looking for something that captured the essence without the legal risk.

When I found **Yumea**, it resonated immediately. It felt like *the one*.

Breaking it down:
- **夢 (yume)** = dream, vision
- **有 (a)** = exist, possess, have

Not just "a dream" but "dream *exists*" — active, declarative, enduring. The dream has substance. It persists even when nightmares encroach.

This wasn't accidental. It was a deliberate, intentional choice. The name carries the game's heart: that healing is real, that harmony exists, that facing fear with courage restores what was broken.

The dream exists.

## The Origin

It started with Jenin's fear of the dark. Bedtime stories about a place where dreams were built. I promised her a game about that place.

Three years later: 12 personas, 3 nightmare tiers, 80 purification cards, countless iterations. The promise kept evolving. The game kept deepening.

Carlie's validation a year later — unprompted, "What happened to that dream game?" — that's my north star. If it lands with her, it can land with others.

**Current status:** Systems locked. Art at 0%. The wiki you're reading is documentation as intervention — breaking the perfectionism loop.

## Why It Exists

Games can be more than entertainment. They can be emotional experiences. They can teach courage through play. They can make healing feel achievable.

Yumea is my attempt at that. For Jenin. For Jannah. For Isa. For everyone who needs to believe that facing fear with support leads to restoration.
