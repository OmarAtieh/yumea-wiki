# What is Yumea?

> *A cooperative board game about healing through dreams.*

---

## In One Sentence

Yumea is a cooperative tile-placement game where players become **Dreamscapers** — emotional guardians who build harmonious structures in a dreamer's subconscious while facing manifestations of their inner fears.

---

## What Makes It Different

**Emotion as Mechanic**

Most games have emotions as theme. Yumea has emotions as *system*. Every mechanic serves an emotional truth:
- Tile placement isn't spatial optimization — it's choosing what to build in someone's psyche
- Nightmares aren't enemies to defeat — they're fears to face with courage
- Harmony isn't points — it's the restoration of emotional balance

**The Mirrored Axis**
Every fear has its counter:
- Fear ↔ Courage
- Despair ↔ Hope
- Isolation ↔ Connection
- Chaos ↔ Balance

The game is this tension. You don't win by destroying nightmares. You win by restoring harmony.

**The Board is the Mind**
Spatial relationships carry emotional weight. Proximity is intimacy. Distance is isolation. The physical layout of tiles represents the psychological landscape.

## Who It's For

**Families**
The cooperative nature, gentle art direction, and emotional scaffolding work for children. The warmth between players mirrors the game's theme.

**Hobbyist Gamers**
Twelve unique personas with distinct abilities. Engine-building through anchor completion. Strategic depth that reveals itself over multiple plays.

**Emotional Players**
Victory feels like healing. Not conquest. Not dominance. Restoration.

---

## The Experience

**Setup (5 minutes)**
A dreamscape board. Tiles in a bag. Nightmare deck shuffled. Each player chooses a persona.

**The Flow (60-90 minutes)**
- **Place a tile** — Build the dreamscape, create harmony through connections
- **Face the nightmare** — Draw a card. Whispers. Echoes. Reverberations.
- **Respond together** — Use abilities, play purification cards, support each other
- **Build anchors** — Complete emotional patterns that restore the dreamer's core

**The Climax**
The board fills. Tension escalates. Nightmares stack. Victory comes from building enough harmony to heal.

## The Name

**Yumea** (夢有) — Japanese for "dream exists."

Previous name: **Dreamscapers** (changed for trademark/IP considerations).

Name meaning:
- **夢 (yume)** = dream, vision
- **有 (a)** = exist, possess, have

"Dream exists" — the dream has substance. It persists even when nightmares encroach.

## The Origin

Per Omar (verified 2026-02-06):
- Game designer and perfectionist **before** Solution Architect career
- Made many games with increasing complexity and intentionality
- Months researching, playing, and thinking about board games after passion reignited
- Carlie told him about her dreams every morning — bringing dreams to the foreground
- Carlie is his muse — inspired the project
- Having children
- Goal: Something to play with wife and kids; share passion with the world
- Personal, intentional, deeply integrating themes of dreams and emotions
- Keeps coming back to Yumea when he has space because it carries weight and is deeply personal

Three years of development: Dreams of Peace → Dreamscapers → Yumea

Carlie's unprompted validation a year later: "What happened to that dream game?"
