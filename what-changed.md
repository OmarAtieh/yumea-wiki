# Yumea — What Changed (Chronological)

> *Track the evolution: What was tried, what stuck, what was dropped.*

---

## 2023: Origin

**Dreams of Peace**
- Promise to Jenin (bedtime stories)
- Homemade childhood games reimagined
- Core concept: Building dreams, facing fears

**What stuck**: Emotional core, cooperative restoration theme
**What evolved**: Everything else

---

## 2024: Framework Lock

**Name Change: Dreamscapers**
- Clearer mechanical identity ("scapers" = active construction)
- 12 personas defined (initial set)
- Mirrored Emotional Axis formalized
- Lexicon-First Design system
- Hex-based tile system locked
- Nightmare 3-tier structure (Whispers → Echoes → Reverberations)

**What stuck**: 12 persona concept, mirrored axis, 3-tier nightmares, hex tiles
**What evolved**: Persona abilities refined multiple times

---

## Early 2025 (Jan–Apr): Consolidation

**Name Change: Yumea** (夢有 = "dream exists")
- IP clearance, trademark considerations
- Easier pronunciation

**GDD v0.7 Systems Locked** (April 2025):
- **12 Personas finalized** with core/ultimate/affinity:
  - Scholar, Architect, Dreamweaver, Brave, Child, Pathfinder
  - Visionary, Trickster, Artisan, Conduit, Envoy, Bloom
- **Hybrid Tile/Anchor System** (Section 5.7)
- **Dream Energy Economy**: 1.3 💠/player/turn, cap at 5
- **Harmony System**: 🕊️ scoring/currency
- **Tension Scaling**: Levels 1–5
- **End Conditions**: Complete 3 Anchors OR Boss defeat

**Content Complete**:
- 80 Purification Cards
- 30 Nightmare Cards (3 tiers)
- 12 Core Blueprints (~40 total framework)
- Tile types: Environmental, Celestial, Dreamtide

**Art Direction Locked** (May 2025):
- Style: "Dreamlike watercolor with crystalline clarity"
- Color palette defined (Harmony: warm golds; Nightmares: desaturated blues)
- 0% executed — prompts prepared but no generation

**What stuck**: All v0.7 systems (still locked today)
**Status**: Systems complete, assets at 0%, ready for production

---

## Mid-2025 (May): Design Explorations (NOT ADOPTED)

**Modular Persona System** (May 19, 2025)
- Explored: Blank slate personas + ability cards (minor/major)
- Emotion resonance points determining affinity
- 3–5 ability slots, draft-based acquisition

**Decision**: NOT adopted
**Reason**: Increased complexity, reduced emotional clarity, family accessibility concerns
**Status**: Documented as exploration, current 12 personas remain locked

**Key Quote**: "The modular version evokes emotional growth through agency... but it also introduces complexity and potential thematic diffusion."

---

## Late 2025 (Jun–Dec): Pause

**What Happened**:
- Asset pipeline complexity exceeded capacity
- Life demands intensified (work, family events)
- **Intentional wellness break** — always intended to return
- Pipeline design continued in background (prompts, validation criteria)

**What was designed but not implemented**:
- Batch workflow: Generate → Validate → Integrate
- Production schedule (Batches 1–5)
- Automation scripts (not coded)

---

## 2026: Documentation & Return

**January 2026**: Reflection, infrastructure recovery

**February 6, 2026**: Major documentation sprint
- State snapshot created
- Wiki built with full chronology
- Gap analysis completed
- Git repository established for version control

---

## Current State (Feb 6, 2026)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **12 Personas** | ✅ Locked | GDD v0.7 — no changes since April 2025 |
| **Core Systems** | ✅ Locked | Tile/Anchor, Economy, Nightmares — unchanged |
| **Content** | ✅ Complete | Cards, blueprints, rules — ready |
| **Art Direction** | ✅ Defined | Style locked, 0% executed |
| **Art Assets** | ❌ 0% | Pipeline designed, not implemented |
| **Print & Play** | ❌ Not started | Next milestone |
| **Playtesting** | ❌ None | Blocked by PnP |

## What Was Dropped (Archive)

| Concept | When | Why Dropped |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Dreams of Peace name | 2024 | Mechanical identity unclear |
| Dreamscapers name | Early 2025 | IP/trademark risk |
| Modular persona system | May 2025 | Too complex, diluted emotion |
| Turn-limited end condition | v0.3 | Anticlimactic |
| 3-energy cap | v0.3 | Too restrictive |
| Various persona ability iterations | 2024–2025 | Balanced to current set |

## Remaining Work (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Asset Pipeline (Now)
- [ ] Finalize prompt templates
- [ ] Generate Batch 1: 10 Nightmares (test pipeline)
- [ ] Validate and iterate
- [ ] Scale to remaining assets

### Phase 2: Print & Play (Feb–Mar)
- [ ] Lock component counts
- [ ] Create print-ready files
- [ ] Test print at home

### Phase 3: Playtesting (Mar–Apr)
- [ ] Carlie playtest (first)
- [ ] Blind playtests
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback

### Phase 4: Ship (Q2–Q3)
- [ ] Publisher pitch OR Kickstarter
- [ ] Final art production
- [ ] Manufacturing
