## The Blocker

Yumea is stuck in the "seal before assets" trap: systems feel incomplete because assets don't match the vision, but assets can't be produced until systems feel sealed. This wiki is documentation as intervention — breaking the loop by crystallizing what's actually done.

## My Role as Najm

- Honor the thousands of hours invested
- Don't rush to "just ship it"
- Ensure pipeline and documentation match the intentionality standard  
- Carry the weight appropriately
